Hello!  I'm a first-year PhD student in theoretical condensed matter physics working with Prof. [Shubhayu Chatterjee](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wovjAPsAAAAJ&hl=en).  I'm interested broadly in quantum many-body systems, and right now I'm working on [tensor network](https://tensornetwork.org/) numerical methods for understanding quantum criticality and thermalization.  

I did my undergrad at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where I worked with Prof. [Xiao-Gang Wen](https://physics.mit.edu/faculty/xiao-gang-wen/) on tensor network algorithms to study gapless topological orders, and I did my masters through the [Perimeter Scholars International](https://perimeterinstitute.ca/psi-masters-program) program at the Perimeter Institute in Waterloo, Ontario, where I worked with Prof. [Sung-Sik Lee](https://perimeterinstitute.ca/people/sung-sik-lee) on functional renormalization for non-Fermi liquids.  

Outside of physics, I'm also interested in linguistics, hiking and [mountaineering](https://peakbagger.com/climber/climber.aspx?cid=33705), singing, and the Lithuanian language and society.  


## Education
- **2023–202?**: PhD in Physics from Carnegie Mellon University
- **2022–2023**: MSc in Theoretical Physics from the University of Waterloo and PSI Certificate from the Perimeter Institute.  Essay title: *Four-fermion interactions and emergent symmetry in a non-Fermi liquid*
- **2018–2022**: BS in Physics and in Mathematics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, with a specialization in Theoretical Condensed Matter Physics


## Teaching
At CMU, I am currently the TA for 33-234, Quantum Physics, and my office hours are Thursdays 10–11 in WH6327. 

In Fall 2023, I was the TA for 33-331, Physical Mechanics I.
