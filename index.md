Hello!  I'm a third-year PhD student in theoretical condensed matter physics working with Prof. [Shubhayu Chatterjee](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wovjAPsAAAAJ&hl=en).  I'm interested broadly in quantum many-body problems, and right now I'm working with [tensor network](https://tensornetwork.org/) numerical methods to understand strongly-correlated magnetism, criticality, and thermalization.  I'm grateful to have been supported by the J. Michael McQuade Fellowship.

I did my undergrad at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where I worked with Prof. [Xiao-Gang Wen](https://physics.mit.edu/faculty/xiao-gang-wen/) on tensor network algorithms to study gapless topological orders, and I did my masters through the [Perimeter Scholars International](https://perimeterinstitute.ca/psi-masters-program) program at the Perimeter Institute in Waterloo, Ontario, where I worked with Prof. [Sung-Sik Lee](https://perimeterinstitute.ca/people/sung-sik-lee) on functional renormalization for non-Fermi liquids.  

Outside of physics, I'm also interested in linguistics, hiking and [mountaineering](https://peakbagger.com/climber/climber.aspx?cid=33705), singing and playing music, and the Lithuanian language and society.  

## Preprints

[Spin-orbital magnetism in moiré Wigner molecules](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06307)
> The interplay of spin and orbital degrees of freedom offers a versatile playground for the realization of a variety of correlated phases of matter. However, the types of spin-orbital interactions are often limited and challenging to tune. Here, we propose and analyze a new platform for spin-orbital interactions based upon a lattice of Wigner molecules in moiré transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). Leveraging the spin-orbital degeneracy of the low-energy Hilbert space of each Wigner molecule, we demonstrate that TMD materials can host a general spin-orbital Hamiltonian that is tunable via the moiré superlattice spacing and dielectric environments. We study the phase diagram for this model, revealing a rich landscape of phases driven by spin-orbital interactions, ranging from ferri-electric valence bond solids to a helical spin liquid. Our work establishes moiré Wigner molecules in TMD materials as a prominent platform for correlated spin-orbital phenomena.
